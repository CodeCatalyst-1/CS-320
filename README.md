Software, Test, Automation

# Project Portfolio

This repository showcases my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. It includes key files from Project One and Project Two that demonstrate my ability to create unit tests, analyze software testing approaches, and apply appropriate testing strategies to meet project requirements.

## Included Files

### Project One: Contact Service
- `Contact.java`
- `ContactService.java`
- `ContactTest.java`
- `ContactServiceTest.java`

These files highlight my skills in developing and testing Java applications. The implementation ensures proper data management for contacts, while unit tests verify that functionality remains intact under various conditions.

### Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report
This document provides an overview of my work and key takeaways from software testing, automation, and quality assurance practices.

## Reflections

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure functionality and security, I implement thorough unit testing using JUnit, covering both expected and edge cases. I also apply secure coding principles, such as input validation and encapsulation, to prevent vulnerabilities. Regular code reviews and static analysis tools help identify potential issues before deployment.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding user needs starts with gathering and analyzing requirements. I break down requirements into specific functionalities and prioritize features based on usability and feasibility. By maintaining clear documentation and iterative development, I ensure that the final product aligns with user expectations.

### How do I approach designing software?
My approach to software design follows an object-oriented methodology, emphasizing modularity and reusability. I start with a clear understanding of requirements, create UML diagrams when needed, and follow design patterns such as MVC (Model-View-Controller) to maintain scalability. Testing is integrated early in development to catch issues before they become significant problems.

This portfolio serves as a testament to my ability to develop robust, well-tested software solutions that meet user requirements effectively.
